File Handling - Read and Write a Text File 
Problem Statement: Write a C# program that reads the contents of a text file and writes it into a new file. If the source file does not exist, display an appropriate message. 
Requirements: Use FileStream for reading and writing. Handle IOException properly. Ensure that the destination file is created if it does not exist.
Buffered Streams - Efficient File Copy 
Problem Statement: Create a C# program that copies a large file (e.g., 100MB) from one location to another using Buffered Streams (BufferedStream). Compare the performance with normal file streams. 
Requirements: Read and write in chunks of 4 KB (4096 bytes). Use Stopwatch to measure execution time. Compare execution time with unbuffered streams.
Read User Input from Console 
Problem Statement: Write a program that asks the user for their name, age, and favorite programming language, then saves this information into a file. 
Requirements: Use StreamReader for console input. Use StreamWriter to write the data into a file. Handle exceptions properly.
Serialization - Save and Retrieve an Object 
Problem Statement: Design a C# program that allows a user to store a list of employees in a file using Object Serialization and later retrieve the data from the file. 
Requirements: Create an Employee class with fields: id, name, department, salary. Serialize the list of employees into a file (BinaryFormatter / JSON Serialization). Deserialize and display the employees from the file. Handle exceptions properly.
ByteArray Stream - Convert Image to ByteArray 
Problem Statement: Write a C# program that converts an image file into a byte array and then writes it back to another image file. Requirements: Use MemoryStream to handle byte arrays. Verify that the new file is identical to the original image. Handle IOException.
Filter Streams - Convert Uppercase to Lowercase
Problem Statement: Create a program that reads a text file and writes its contents into another file, converting all uppercase letters to lowercase. 
Requirements: Use StreamReader and StreamWriter. Use BufferedStream for efficiency. Handle character encoding issues.
Data Streams - Store and Retrieve Primitive Data 
Problem Statement: Write a C# program that stores student details (roll number, name, GPA) in a binary file and retrieves it later. 
Requirements: Use BinaryWriter to write primitive data. Use BinaryReader to read data. Ensure proper closing of resources.
Piped Streams - Inter-Thread Communication 
Problem Statement: Implement a C# program where one thread writes data into a PipeStream and another thread reads data from it. 
Requirements: Use two threads for reading and writing. Synchronize properly to prevent data loss. Handle IOException.
Read a Large File Line by Line
Problem Statement: Develop a C# program that efficiently reads a large text file (500MB+) line by line and prints only lines containing the word "error". 
Requirements: Use StreamReader for efficient reading. Read line-by-line instead of loading the entire file. Display only lines containing "error" (case insensitive).
Count Words in a File 
Problem Statement: Write a C# program that counts the number of words in a given text file and displays the top 5 most frequently occurring words. 
Requirements: Use StreamReader to read the file. Use a Dictionary<string, int> to count word occurrences. Sort the words based on frequency and display the top 5.
